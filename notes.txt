Requested output:

Tabular data with columns:
* session start date (truncate at hours)
* site id
* gr (control or experiment)
* ad
* browser
* number of sessions
* number of conversions
* number of transactions
* sum of revenue

Thinking through the logic. Probably want a row per unique user within the time
period of the data set... no that won't work. For each session, just report that
session. So the other data has to be aggregated.

Or aggregate each hour, like how many sessions in each hour, how many
conversions etc... that seems like more directly useful analysis for a business
owner. So the next thing I need to figure out how to do is make a histogram out
of the data.

If the first five columns are keys, output data should look like:
00:00, site_0, control, campaign_A, IE, #, #, #, #
00:00, site_0, experim, campaign_A, IE, #, #, #, #
00:00, site_1, control, campaign_A, IE, #, #, #, #
00:00, site_1, control, campaign_B, IE, #, #, #, #

date_trunc('hour', session.st)

I probably need to build an intermediate table that has the content joined
together first, then aggregate that.
