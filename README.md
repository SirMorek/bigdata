Further thoughts on the assignment:

#) Data sanity/sanitization of input:
I don't really know anything about the trustworthyness of the data source, and
the various bounds that the records might be expected to conform to.

If I am able to assume that the records are generated according to a
pre-existing and conformant schema the amount of work needed to be done at
analysis time drops significantly so I went with that assumption.

If I had to anticipate malicious/malformed data, I would want to build a
pipeline stage specifically for inspecting the incoming data for schema
correctness. Examples: Revenue should probably only be positive values, but
there is a logical upper bound on transactions as well.

I don't know if sessions that are not correlated to ad features is something to
note or observe on. In the real world there are ad blockers or other reasons why
someone would not necessarily be served ad content, so I'm not sure how that
sort of thing gets expressed in analysis. Would it be prudent to highlight
any revenue divorced from ad campaigns, or would it be in our best interest to
filter out those data points as distracting since our customer is focused on
understanding the comparative value of different ad campaigns?

Hypothetical summary, if I was to tackle data sanity:
Describe model for permissible inputs.
Run ingest data through model, alerting on departures from model.
Scan initially for statisical outliers, warn to make visible.
Pass filtered data on to analysis script as currently presented.

#) Clean history

The git history presented right now is of very little utility. It shows mostly
the "Figure it out as I go" development, which is a class of history but not a
particularly useful one. Definitely not the kind of history that I would put
into production.

If I spent some more time on this, I would re-write the history to provide a
more meaningful evolution of the design of project. The desired history would
show how the project is built up from base functionality, and
components/functionality built ontop of a stable framework going forward. That
version of history would help formalize and stabilize the design of the solution
so that each change is understandable as building towards the goal.

The current history is at least nominally clean, in that I believe every commit
functions and runs to some solution. So the effort in the rewrite would mostly
be in getting the design components established earlier in the history and
getting rid of the debug nonsense.

#) Automated testing

I didn't get to a fully mature point on automated testing for this project, but
if this was intended to become part of a production pipeline that delivered
ongoing customer value we would need at least a minimum of guardrails to prevent
regression.

To that I would probably push for firmer component design and compose testing
around that. Most of the interfaces we will care about (I think) boil down to
"Perform logical operation on spark DataFrame with assumed set of columns". Thus
we could make test cases out of trivially constructed DataFrames that present
subsets of the appropriate columns. Many of the trivial errors we could prevent
relate to the use of string matching around column names, or the correct
composition of operation chains.

Some slightly non-trivial data sets could be used to evaluate whether the
desired aggregations are done correctly while staying visually inspectable, for
instance a row count <=20. Then the corpus used for this assignment itself could
qualify as a useful representative sample of real world data, and the pipeline
could be validated going forward from there.

#) Documentation

This project got to the very border of what kind of complexity I personally feel
okay with being documented by clear code versus literally documented. If the
target audience has a strong background in spark/SQL I believe I followed a
conventional enough approach that there would be no surprises. However, if the
audience is not expected to be familiar, I would feel compelled to document the
expected behaviour of the analysis components as well as the major SQL functions
I took advantage of.

#) Ongoing development

There are some ways the design could have been made more open for changes in
requirements. For instance, all of the column names are hard coded in a way that
if a new column was added it could be error prone to correctly add it to the
analysis. A more model based approach would help prevent some of those
headaches, but is more effort to set up and does presume that will be the way
that requirements might change.

There was little thought spent on the actual scaling and parallelism of work,
given that my development environment was a single system. You see artifacts
like forcing coalescence just to make the bash sorting at the end simpler, when
in practice that would be missing the whole point. Aside from that, I don't
believe I made any specific problems for scaling the solution. With a larger
data set and larger environment, I would be interested in learning more about
how spark can take advantage of caching/memoizing. Repeating analysis with
small tweaks of logic should be faster than I experienced, but I think some
work has to be spent to take advantage of those capabilities.

#) Reporting/Visualization

To get anywhere with most reports, at some point someone is going to need to
load the report into a visualization tool. I'm not sure what the state of art
in that space is, my previous experience was with Tableau but that seemed like
an enterprise solution. If this was my problem full stack, I might have wanted
to spend my time talking with the customer about what kind of insights they were
hoping to get and how they were expecting to interact with them. Some might want
a processed data packet to load into their own reporting suite, some might want
an email with an attached slide deck of the net findings.
